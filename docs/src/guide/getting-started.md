# Getting Started

Get Gaze running in under 10 minutes: install, enroll your face, and verify authentication.

## Before you begin

- Linux desktop with a working PipeWire/GStreamer webcam
- `sudo` access
- Internet connection for first-time model download

## Step 1: Install Gaze

Recommended one-line installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gaze.gundulabs.com/install.sh | sh
```

If you prefer manual package setup, use the [installation guide](/guide/installation).

## Step 2: Check daemon status

```bash
systemctl status gazed
```

If it is not running:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now gazed
```

## Step 3: Enroll your first face

```bash
gaze add-face default
```

Tips while enrolling:

- Keep your face centered and well lit.
- Face the camera naturally for the first capture; the remaining direction
  prompts are measured relative to that pose.
- Use small, deliberate movements and hold each prompted angle still.
- Remove strong backlight if possible.

## Step 4: Test authentication

```bash
gaze auth
```

For extra details:

```bash
gaze auth --verbose
```

## Step 5: Open the GUI (optional)

```bash
gaze-gui
```

Use the GUI to enroll additional face profiles (for example, with glasses and without glasses).

## Step 6: Verify GNOME lock screen auth (optional)

Only do this on GNOME if you want face unlock from the lock screen. The one-line installer enables the extension for the current GNOME user when possible. If you installed packages manually or the installer could not enable it automatically, run:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable gaze@gundulabs.com
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze enable-face-authentication true
```

Run those from a GNOME session that started **after** the package was installed. GNOME Shell only scans extension directories at session start and drops IDs it does not recognise, so enabling the extension from the session you installed in can look correct and then vanish at the next logout. Reboot, then re-run the two commands. `gaze doctor` reports this as `GNOME extension: installed, but not enabled for the current user` and prints the same steps. See [The extension disappears again after a logout](/guide/gnome#the-extension-disappears-again-after-a-logout).

Hands-free lock screen and GDM login face auth through this extension are GNOME-specific. KDE Plasma gets a hands-free lock screen a different way, through the biometric PAM slot KScreenLocker starts up front, see [KDE Plasma](/guide/kde). Other desktops integrate the lock screen through PAM instead, see [Hyprland](/guide/hyprland) and [PAM](/guide/pam).
GDM login face auth is separate and disabled by default due to GNOME keyring behavior.
See [GNOME Extension](/guide/gnome) for details and optional login enablement.

## If something fails

Go to the [troubleshooting guide](/guide/troubleshooting) for camera, daemon, PAM, and low-match issues.

## Next

- Tune behavior in the [configuration guide](/guide/configuration)
- Learn commands in the [CLI guide](/guide/cli)
- Use the desktop app via the [GUI guide](/guide/gui)
- Review PAM setup in [PAM](/guide/pam)
- Review lock/login behavior in [GNOME Extension](/guide/gnome)
- Set up the [KDE Plasma](/guide/kde) lock screen and System Settings page
- Enable face unlock for [Hyprland (hyprlock)](/guide/hyprland)
