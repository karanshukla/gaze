# Nix & NixOS

Gaze ships a Nix flake with packages for the daemon, CLI, GUI, and GNOME Shell
extension, plus a NixOS module that wires up everything the distro packages do
imperatively: the `gazed` systemd service, D-Bus and polkit policies, PAM
integration, and GNOME/GDM defaults.

Face authentication needs a system daemon and PAM configuration, so the NixOS
module is the recommended path. On non-NixOS systems with Nix (including
home-manager), you can install the CLI and GUI from the flake, but the daemon
and PAM modules must come from your distro's Gaze package, the same split as
the Flatpak.

## Flake outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `packages.<system>.gaze` | `gazed` daemon, `gaze` CLI, and the PAM modules |
| `packages.<system>.gaze-gui` | GTK4/Adwaita configuration GUI |
| `packages.<system>.gaze-gnome-extension` | GNOME Shell extension |
| `packages.<system>.default` | Alias for `packages.<system>.gaze` |
| `nixosModules.gaze` | NixOS module (`services.gaze.*`) |
| `nixosModules.default` | Alias for `nixosModules.gaze` |
| `overlays.default` | Adds the three packages to `pkgs` |
| `devShells.<system>.default` | Development shell with the full build environment |

`<system>` is `x86_64-linux` or `aarch64-linux`.

## NixOS

Add the flake input and import the module:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    gaze = {
      url = "github:GunduLabs/gaze";
      # Optional, saves a second nixpkgs evaluation. Only do this if your
      # nixpkgs is unstable: Gaze is edition 2024, and a stable channel's
      # older rustc fails partway through the dependency tree (`kstring`,
      # pulled in by the gstreamer crate, is usually the first to break).
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
    };
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, gaze, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.myhost = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      modules = [
        gaze.nixosModules.default
        {
          services.gaze = {
            enable = true;
            gui.enable = true;
          };

          # `sudo` and `polkit-1` attempt face auth out of the box, with the
          # password still available as a fallback. Other PAM services opt in
          # one at a time, e.g.:
          # security.pam.services.hyprlock.gaze.enable = true;
        }
        # ... the rest of your configuration
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Then rebuild and enroll:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
gaze add-face default
gaze auth --verbose
```

The recognition models are downloaded by the daemon into `/var/cache/gaze` on
first use, exactly as on other distros.

::: warning ONNX Runtime version
`gazed` links the `onnxruntime` package from the nixpkgs revision the flake is
built with, and needs ONNX Runtime 1.21 or newer. Newer runtimes are fine, since
`gazed` asks for the 1.21 API. If your nixpkgs ships something older, the daemon
exits at startup with a message naming both versions; pin the flake's `nixpkgs`
input to a revision with a newer `onnxruntime` instead of overriding `follows`.

### Module options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `services.gaze.enable` | `false` | Run `gazed` and install the CLI and PAM modules |
| `services.gaze.package` | flake's `gaze` | Daemon/CLI/PAM package |
| `services.gaze.settings` | `{ }` | Options merged over the upstream defaults into `/etc/gaze/config.toml` (see [Configuration](/guide/configuration)) |
| `services.gaze.mutableConfig` | `true` | Seed `/etc/gaze/config.toml` once and leave it editable (the GUI writes to it). Set to `false` for a fully declarative, read-only config |
| `services.gaze.pam.defaultServices` | `[ "sudo" "polkit-1" ]` | PAM services that get face auth without further configuration |
| `security.pam.services.<name>.gaze.enable` | true for `pam.defaultServices` | Attempt face auth for this PAM service |
| `security.pam.services.<name>.gaze.control` | `"sufficient"` | PAM control field for the rule |
| `security.pam.services.<name>.gaze.simultaneous` | `false` | Pass `simultaneous` to `pam_gaze.so` (face and password prompt at the same time) instead of sequential authentication |
| `security.pam.services.<name>.gaze.retry` | `false` | Add a second `pam_gaze.so retry` rule below `pam_unix`, giving face auth one more attempt after a rejected password |
| `security.pam.services.<name>.gaze.order` | `null` | Explicit rule `order`; `null` places gaze ahead of `pam_fprintd` and `pam_unix` |
| `services.gaze.gui.enable` | `false` | Install `gaze-gui` |
| `services.gaze.gui.package` | flake's `gaze-gui` | GUI package |
| `services.gaze.gnome.enable` | `false` | Install the GNOME Shell extension and the `gdm-face` PAM service |
| `services.gaze.gnome.extensionPackage` | flake's `gaze-gnome-extension` | GNOME Shell extension package |
| `services.gaze.gnome.enableForUsers` | `true` | Turn the extension and lock screen face auth on in every GNOME user session via dconf defaults. Set to `false` if you manage `enabled-extensions` yourself |
| `services.gaze.gnome.gdmFaceLogin` | `false` | Also enable face auth at the GDM login screen (read the [GNOME guide](/guide/gnome) first) |
| `services.gaze.kde.lockScreen` | `false` | Define `kde-fingerprint` so the Plasma lock screen starts face unlock with no key press |
| `services.gaze.kde.loginScreen` | `false` | Also run face auth in the Plasma Login Manager / SDDM stack (submit-driven; see the [KDE guide](/guide/kde)) |
| `services.gaze.tpm.tcti` | `null` | `TPM2TOOLS_TCTI` for the daemon, e.g. `"device:/dev/tpm0"`. Only needed when neither `/dev/tpmrm0` nor `/dev/tpm0` is the right node |

The gaze PAM rule is inserted ahead of both `pam_fprintd` and `pam_unix`, so
face auth is tried first and the fingerprint reader and password both remain
fallbacks. To put gaze somewhere else in the stack, set `order`, offsetting
from the neighbouring rule rather than from a constant (nixpkgs assigns those
numbers automatically and they change between releases):

```nix
# Try the fingerprint reader first, then gaze, then the password.
security.pam.services.login.gaze = {
  enable = true;
  order = config.security.pam.services.login.rules.auth.fprintd.order + 5;
};
```

::: warning `rules` is experimental
`security.pam.services.<name>.rules` is an experimental nixpkgs option that
can change without notice, and the `order` numbers of the built-in rules move
between releases. Always offset from a neighbouring rule as above instead of
assigning a constant, or a nixpkgs update can silently reorder your stack.
:::

For anything the options don't cover, use
`security.pam.services.<name>.rules` directly with
`${config.services.gaze.package}/lib/security/pam_gaze.so`.

::: warning `settings` is applied once
With the default `mutableConfig = true`, `/etc/gaze/config.toml` is seeded on
first activation and never overwritten again, so later changes to
`services.gaze.settings` have no effect on a machine that already has the
file. Either edit `/etc/gaze/config.toml` (or use the GUI), delete it and
rebuild to re-seed it, or set `mutableConfig = false` for a fully declarative
config.
:::

### Cameras

Leave `settings.cameras.rgb` unset unless you have a specific reason to pin a
camera: the default, `"primary"`, resolves the primary color camera at
runtime. A pinned value must be a PipeWire node identity, not a device path;
`pipewiresrc target-object=/dev/video0` does not match anything. Run
`gaze doctor` to see the sources PipeWire currently advertises, and copy one
of those strings verbatim.

### GNOME lock screen

```nix
services.gaze.gnome.enable = true;
```

That installs the extension and, through
`services.gaze.gnome.enableForUsers` (on by default), writes dconf defaults
into the `user` profile that load it and switch lock screen face auth on for
every GNOME session. Log out and back in after the rebuild: GNOME Shell only
scans extension directories at session start, so a running session will not
pick up a newly installed extension.

Those are defaults, not locks. To change them for your user, use the Extensions
app or the extension preferences:

```bash
gnome-extensions prefs gaze@gundulabs.com
```

Whatever you set there is written to your own dconf database and wins over the
system default from then on.

The extension's settings schema is installed inside the extension directory
rather than into the system schema path, so a bare
`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze …` cannot find it. If you want
to set the key from a script, write it through dconf instead, which does not
need the schema:

```bash
dconf write /org/gnome/shell/extensions/gaze/enable-face-authentication true
```

If you already manage `org/gnome/shell` `enabled-extensions` yourself, in
home-manager or your own `programs.dconf.profiles.user` database, set
`services.gaze.gnome.enableForUsers = false;` and add
`gaze@gundulabs.com` to your own list instead. Two system databases that both
set the key shadow each other rather than merging, and only the one listed
first in the profile takes effect.

GDM *login* face auth stays disabled unless you set
`services.gaze.gnome.gdmFaceLogin = true;`. The extension preferences and
`gaze doctor` both report whatever that option compiled into the GDM dconf
profile, but the toggle itself cannot change it: the profile belongs to your
NixOS configuration, so switching it there is the only way.

### hyprlock

```nix
programs.hyprlock.enable = true;
security.pam.services.hyprlock.gaze.enable = true;
# or, for simultaneous face + password:
# security.pam.services.hyprlock.gaze = { enable = true; simultaneous = true; };
```

This modifies the `hyprlock` PAM service in place, so no `auth_pam_module`
changes in `hyprlock.conf` are needed. See the [Hyprland guide](/guide/hyprland)
for behavior details.

### KDE Plasma

```nix
services.gaze.kde.lockScreen = true;
```

That defines the `kde-fingerprint` PAM service, the slot KScreenLocker starts up
front for biometrics, so face unlock begins with no key press. It also turns
`security.pam.services.kde.gaze.enable` off, because the greeter runs the
interactive `kde` service at the same time and two clients would fight over one
camera. Don't set `kde.gaze.enable` by hand: that is the old submit-driven wiring
and it conflicts with this one.

The login greeter is separate and opt-in, because upstream gives it no up-front
biometric slot, so face auth only runs when the login form is submitted:

```nix
services.gaze.kde.loginScreen = true;
```

KWallet will ask for its password once per session after a face login, since
there was no password to hand it. See the [KDE Plasma guide](/guide/kde).

The System Settings entry ships in the `gaze-kde` package rather than the NixOS
module, so on Nix use `gaze add-face` or `services.gaze.gui.enable`.

### Other desktops

Add the relevant PAM service names, e.g.:

```nix
security.pam.services.login.gaze.enable = true; # console/display-manager login
```

### Uninstalling

Don't use `gaze uninstall` on NixOS; it drives distro package managers.
Remove the module (or set `services.gaze.enable = false;`), rebuild, and
delete the leftover state if you want a clean slate:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/gaze /var/cache/gaze /etc/gaze
```

## Nix without NixOS, and home-manager

The packages work with plain `nix profile` and with home-manager:

```bash
nix profile install github:GunduLabs/gaze#gaze-gui
```

```nix
# home-manager
home.packages = [
  inputs.gaze.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.gaze-gui
];
```

These talk to `gazed` over the system bus, so the daemon and PAM integration
must already be installed system-wide, either via the NixOS module or via
your distro's Gaze package ([Installation](/guide/installation)).
Installing only the flake packages on a non-NixOS system does **not** set up
the daemon, its D-Bus/polkit policies, or PAM.

## Development shell

```bash
nix develop github:GunduLabs/gaze
# or, in a checkout:
nix develop
```

The shell provides the Rust toolchain and all native build inputs (OpenCV,
GStreamer, GTK4, ONNX Runtime, tpm2-tss) with the `ORT_STRATEGY=system`
environment already set, so `cargo build` works out of the box.
