> [!NOTE]
> Gaze includes local liveness anti-spoofing and support for infrared (IR) cameras to secure authentication against spoofing attacks. For high-security environments, it is recommended to keep standard system authentication active as a fallback.

Facial authentication for Linux with on-device face recognition, PAM integration, and tools for login, lock screen, sudo, and desktop management.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gaze.gundulabs.com/install.sh | sh
```

The installer installs the Gaze daemon, CLI, and GUI. It supports openSUSE Tumbleweed on x86_64 through its native `zypper` package manager and a Tumbleweed-specific RPM repository. It installs the GNOME Shell extension only when it detects a GNOME desktop session; on KDE Plasma it installs `gaze-kde` instead, and on other non-GNOME desktops it skips GNOME-specific packages so it does not pull in GNOME Shell. If you installed the GNOME extension manually or automatic enablement was not possible, reboot (so GNOME Shell scans the new extension) and then run from GNOME:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable gaze@gundulabs.com
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze enable-face-authentication true
```

> Running `gnome-extensions enable` before rebooting will return `Extension "gaze@gundulabs.com" does not exist`. Shell only rescans extension directories at session start.

<summary>Manual install (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/openSUSE RPM systems, Arch/Manjaro/CachyOS)</summary>

**Debian / Ubuntu**

Each apt suite carries only the builds for that release: `noble` (Ubuntu 24.04), `questing` (Ubuntu 25.10), `resolute` (Ubuntu 26.04), `trixie` (Debian 13), `forky` (Debian 14, testing).

```bash
sudo mkdir -p --mode=0755 /usr/share/keyrings

**Fedora and compatible DNF systems**

```bash

**Fedora via Copr** (alternative to the repository above; do not enable both)

```bash
sudo dnf install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf copr enable @gundulabs/gaze

```

**openSUSE Tumbleweed (x86_64)**

sudo zypper install gaze gaze-gui
```

**Arch / Manjaro / CachyOS**

```bash
# Requires an AUR helper such as yay or paru. yay shown here.
yay -S --needed gaze-bin gaze-gui-bin
```

**Flatpak (GUI only; also install one of the system packages above for the `gazed` daemon)**

```bash
flatpak install --from https://packages.gundulabs.com/flatpak/com.gundulabs.Gaze.flatpakref
```

On openSUSE Tumbleweed, the RPM post-install script enables the shared PAM stack; reapply it manually with `sudo pam-config --add --gaze && sudo pam-config --update` if needed. For GNOME lock screen face unlock after manual package installation, also install `gaze-gnome-extension` (`gaze-gnome-extension-bin` on Arch), reboot, then from your GNOME session run `gnome-extensions enable gaze@gundulabs.com` and `gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.gaze enable-face-authentication true`. On KDE Plasma, install `gaze-kde` (`gaze-kde-bin` on Arch) for hands-free lock screen face unlock and a Face Unlock entry in System Settings; see the [KDE guide](https://gaze.gundulabs.com/guide/kde).

<details>
<summary>Nix / NixOS (flake)</summary>

The repo is a Nix flake with packages (`gaze`, `gaze-gui`, `gaze-gnome-extension`) and a NixOS module that configures the daemon, D-Bus/polkit, and PAM declaratively:

```nix
# flake.nix inputs
inputs.gaze.url = "github:GunduLabs/gaze";

# NixOS configuration
imports = [ inputs.gaze.nixosModules.default ];
services.gaze = {
  enable = true;
  gui.enable = true;
};
```

See the [Nix & NixOS guide](https://gaze.gundulabs.com/guide/nixos) for module options, GNOME lock screen setup, hyprlock, and home-manager usage.

</details>

After installation (any method), reboot once to ensure all system-level changes are fully applied.

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Enroll your face
gaze add-face default

# Test authentication
gaze auth

# Or use the GUI
gaze-gui
```

## How it works

Gaze runs a daemon (`gazed`) that communicates over DBus. When authentication is requested (by PAM at login, the GNOME extension on the lock screen, or the CLI), the daemon captures a frame from your webcam, detects and aligns the face, computes an embedding using an ONNX model, and compares it against stored enrollments.

All processing happens locally. Face embeddings are stored on disk, not transmitted anywhere.

```
Camera → Face Detection (SCRFD) → Alignment → Embedding (ArcFace) → Match → Liveness (MiniFASNet-V2)
```

## Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `gazed` | System daemon exposing `com.gundulabs.Gaze` on DBus |
| `gaze` | CLI for enrollment and authentication (crate: `gaze-cli`) |
| `gaze-gui` | GTK4/Adwaita graphical application |
| `pam-gaze` | PAM module for login/lock screen integration |
| `gaze-gnome-extension` | GNOME Shell extension for lock screen auth |
| `gaze-hyprlock` | PAM service for hyprlock face unlock on Hyprland |

## Configuration

```toml
# /etc/gaze/config.toml
[inference]
execution_provider = "cpu" # cpu | openvino (requires an OpenVINO build)
device = "cpu"             # cpu, or gpu | npu on an OpenVINO build

[security]
level = "medium"    # low | medium | high | maximum | custom

[cameras]
rgb = "primary"
dark_luma_threshold = 20

[auth]
abort_if_ssh = true
abort_if_lid_closed = true

[enrollment]
max_templates = 2
min_face_size_ratio = 0.25

[liveness]
enabled = true
threshold = 0.8
```

OpenVINO selects its device at run time. An OpenVINO-enabled installation
should use `execution_provider = "openvino"` and `device = "npu"` to select the
Intel NPU. The same binary can select the Intel GPU by changing `device` to
`"gpu"`. The released packages are CPU-only; OpenVINO requires building from
source with `just build-rust-openvino`.

See the [configuration guide](https://gaze.gundulabs.com/guide/configuration) for all options.

## CLI usage

```
gaze add-face <name>         Enroll a new face
gaze refine-face <name>      Add samples to an existing enrollment
gaze auth                    Authenticate
gaze auth --verbose          Authenticate with detailed metrics
gaze auth --silent           Authenticate silently (exit code only)
gaze list-faces              List enrolled faces
gaze rename-face <old> <new> Rename a face
gaze remove-face <name>      Remove a face
gaze clear-user              Remove all face data for current user
gaze config                  Interactive configuration editor
gaze config --show           Print current config and exit
gaze doctor                  Check config, daemon, cameras, enrollments, PAM, and TPM
gaze doctor --benchmark      Also measure detector/recognizer/liveness inference speed
gaze uninstall               Completely remove Gaze (packages, PAM, config, models, data)
gaze uninstall -y            Skip confirmation prompt
```

Enrollment first captures a straight-on reference, then asks for small up, down,
left, and right movements relative to that reference.

## Building from source

**Dependencies:** Rust 1.85+, [`just` 1.51+](https://github.com/casey/just), [`nfpm`](https://nfpm.goreleaser.com)

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config clang libclang-dev \
  libopencv-dev libv4l-dev libpam0g-dev libtss2-dev libssl-dev \
  libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev \
  libcairo2-dev libglib2.0-dev libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libgraphene-1.0-dev \
  libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
  gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-pipewire \
  gettext-base

# Build
just build-rust

# Build with OpenVINO support (requires an OpenVINO-enabled system ONNX Runtime)
just build-rust-openvino

# Package
just package <deb | rpm | archlinux>
```

### Building without opencv-devel (Fedora)

OpenCV is used by the daemon's detection pipeline, not just the GUI, so even a
[GUI-less build](https://gaze.gundulabs.com/guide/development) (`GAZE_GUI=0`)
still needs its headers. On Fedora, `opencv-devel` hard-requires every OpenCV
module — including `opencv-viz`, which pulls in VTK and OpenCascade: **123
packages, ~751 MiB** to link two libraries.

Gaze links only `opencv_core` and `opencv_imgproc`, both shipped in small
runtime packages. `just fetch-opencv-headers` extracts the 8.9 MiB of headers
from the `-devel` rpm without installing it, and points the link symlinks at
those runtime libraries:

```bash
sudo dnf install opencv-core opencv-imgproc   # runtime libs, ~10 MiB
just fetch-opencv-headers                     # headers only, no dependencies
GAZE_GUI=0 just build-rust-openvino
```

Every build recipe picks the sysroot up automatically once it exists, and falls
back to the normal pkg-config probe when it does not. `just clean-opencv-headers`
removes it. Debian's `libopencv-dev` and Arch's `opencv` have no equivalent
problem, so this is only needed on Fedora and derivatives.
